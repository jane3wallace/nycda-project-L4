# NYCDA WD Lesson 4: <i>Github/Personal Website</i>
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 2 Lecture 2. This project was to create a static 3 page website that incorporated a photo gallery and a nav bar.

### Assignment:
Submit your personal website project using a GitHub link that includes the following:

* At least 3 separate pages

* Uses CSS layout principles we’ve learned including adding a gutter to the left and right of the page and at least one page with a two-column layout

* Doesn’t use images where CSS and HTML could be used

* Includes photographs

* Has links to external websites that open in a new window

* Incorporates a \<ul> powered navigation bar
